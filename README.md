# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

## Results

- There are 72,458 employees reaching retirement soon. 
- The mentopship elibability analysis returned only 1549 employees. 

## Summary

- The mentor pool is large and there is alot of potential for retiring employees to mento the younger employees. However, there is a significant gap between eligably mentees and retiring mentors. The company will likely need to hire from outside to fill the empty poistions stemming from the high level of retirements.
